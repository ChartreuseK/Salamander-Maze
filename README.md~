# Salamander Escape the Maze

A 2nd year class assignment at the University of Calgary in computing machinery that I enjoyed enough to go above and beyond the original specifications. This is a **bare-metal** ARM assembly game for the Raspberry Pi. 

It is a simple tile based maze game where you collect keys to open doors and to reach the exit. Each level has a maximum number of actions (moving and opening doors) that you can take to complete the maze. The game has 6 mazes that the player can "challenge" themselves to complete.

## Prerequisites 

1. Raspberry Pi and Power Cable(I think that's a given)
2. SD Card 
3. Screen and HDMI (or HDMI to DVI) cable (Untested but it *may* work over composite)
4. SNES Controller (and someway of hooking it's pins up to the Pi)
5. arm-none-eabi cross compiler toolkit

## Setup

1. The SD card needs to setup with a FAT partition containing the files nessisary to boot the pi, an easy (but bandwidth intensive and requires a 4GB+ card) way is to use the NOOBS installer image on the pi (http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md) and get it to setup the boot partition. A much smaller way is to grab the files from https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot and put them on the root directory of a FAT formated SD card
2. Run **make**
3. Copy the generated **kernel.img** file to the SD card replacing the existing kernel.img
4. Connect the SNES controller to the pi.
* Latch to pin 9
* Data to pin 10
* Clock to pin 11
* Power to 3.3v (Yes the SNES controller is 5v logic but it **will** run at 3.3v to simplify interfacing)
* Ground
5. Plug the SD card and HDMI cables into the Pi
6. Power it up
